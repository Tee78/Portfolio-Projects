# Data Portfolio-Projects

Welcome! This portfolio showcases a selection of data projects that demonstrate my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and business reporting. Each project reflects practical problem-solving, data analysis, and the ability to draw insights from data.

## Projects

### 1. Sales Data Analysis (Python)
- Created and analysed a simulated sales dataset using Python dictionaries
- Calculated total revenue, revenue per item, unique item counts and so on.
- Applied loops, conditionals, functions, and introductory object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- Focused on data aggregation, sorting, and error handling

### 2. Donation Data Analysis (SQL)
- Analysed donation records using SQL queries
- Extracted total donations, donor counts, and trends  
- Practiced filtering, aggregation, and joining tables to uncover insights

### 3. Customer Sales Analysis (Power BI)
- Built interactive dashboards to visualise retail sales data
- Analysed top-performing products, revenue trends, and customer behaviour
- Applied data transformation and visual storytelling techniques

### 4. Coffee Shop Sales Report
- Prepared a detailed sales report for a coffee shop
- Summarised revenue, analysed sales patterns, and created charts for business decisions
- Practiced Excel reporting and presenting insights in a professional format

### Sales Visualisation Using Matplotlib (Python)

This project demonstrates the use of Matplotlib to create clear and informative data visualisations 
from a simulated sales dataset. The objective was to present sales trends and comparisons using properly labelled charts suitable for business reporting.

Key features include:
- Creation of bar and/or line charts using Matplotlib
- Use of descriptive titles and axis labels
- Customisation of axis ticks for improved readability
- Visual representation of sales and revenue insights


## Tools & Skills
- Python: lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, OOP
- SQL: querying, aggregation, filtering, joining
- Power BI: dashboards, data visualisation, storytelling
- Excel: charts, summaries, reporting

## About Me


I am a data analyst with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel, and other analytical tools, skilled at transforming raw data into actionable insights that support business decisions. My expertise spans data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and reporting, using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyse and present complex datasets clearly and effectively.

I have developed and delivered insights from both simulated and real-world datasets, building dashboards, reports, and visualisations that highlight trends, identify opportunities, and drive decision-making. I am proficient in SQL for querying and aggregating data from relational databases, as well as Excel and Power BI for business reporting and interactive dashboards.

Beyond technical skills, I approach data with a problem-solving mindset, focusing on accuracy, clarity, and impact. I am seeking internship opportunities to contribute my analytical expertise, deliver meaningful insights, and collaborate on data-driven projects that create measurable business value.
